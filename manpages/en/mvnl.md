# NAME

mvnl - Simple and lightweight Java project manager inspired by the
`Maven` project manager.

# SYNOPSIS

mvnl \[OPTION\]\... \[ARGUMENT\]\...

# DESCRIPTION

Allows compiling and running a Java project with minimal
options and manipulations. Facilitates the compilation and execution
of a Java project more straightforwardly than Maven.

The order of options does not matter.

If an option is used multiple times, only the last one is considered,
except for options that take multiple arguments such as
\--arguments, \--classpath, and \--exclude.

We strongly recommend using the default directory structure
generated by the `mvnl --create` command. This allows you to
compile and run your Java project without having a configuration file
or specifying options on the command line, except for the -c and -l options.

# EXAMPLES

-   `mvnl -s src -t target -c -e UTF-8` \--\> compiles the Java project with
    UTF-8 encoding located in the src folder and places the compiled
    files in the target folder.

-   `mvnl -s src -t target -m package.Main -cl` \--\> compiles and launches the
    Java project located in the src folder, places the compiled files
    in the target folder, and then launches the package.Main class.

-   `mvnl -s src -t target -m package.Main -lc -args "argument 1" "argument 2"`
    \--\> compiles and launches the Java project located in the
    src folder, places the compiled files in the target folder, then launches the
    package.Main class with the arguments `argument 1` and `argument 2` in
    the order passed to the command.

-   `mvnl -m package.Main -l -cp target lib` \--\> launches the
    package.Main class by adding the target folder and the lib folder to
    the project's classpath.

-   `mvnl -m Main -lib lib -l` \--\> launches the Main class by adding all
    JAR files in the lib folder and its subfolders to the project's classpath.

-   `mvnl -f config.txt -cl` \--\> loads options from the
    config.txt file. Content of the config.txt file:
    `-s src -t target -m package.Main`. Compiles and launches the Java project located
    in the src folder, places the compiled files in the
    bin folder, then launches the package.Main class.

# DEFAULT BEHAVIOR

By default, if no options are specified, the `mvnl` command
displays a stylized view of the `mvnl --version` command output.

# OPTIONS
