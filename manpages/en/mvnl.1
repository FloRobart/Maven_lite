.SH NAME
mvnl - Lightweight and simple Java project manager inspired by
the \f[CR]Maven\f[R] project manager.
.SH SYNOPSIS
mvnl [OPTION]...
[ARGUMENT]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Allows compiling and running a Java project using minimal
options and manipulations.
Facilitates Java project compilation and execution more
simply than Maven.
.PP
All options take a single argument except for -c and -l, which take none.
.PP
The order of options doesn't matter except for
the --file (-f) and --help (-h) options, which must be the first option on the command line if used.
Double quotes are not required.
.PP
Options used with -c while they are only usable with -l are ignored, and vice versa.
Options usable with -c or -l are also usable with -cl
and -lc.
.PP
Mandatory arguments for long options are also mandatory for
short options. For example, -s and --source are equivalent.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl -s src -o bin -c -e UTF-8\f[R] --> compiles the Java project
with UTF-8 encoding located in the src directory and places the
compiled files in the bin directory.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl -s src -o bin -m package.Main -cl\f[R] --> compiles and
runs the Java project located in the src directory, puts the
compiled files in the bin directory, and then runs the package.Main class.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl -s src -o bin -m package.Main -lc -arg argument_1 -arg argument_2\f[R]
--> compiles and runs the Java project located in the src directory
and puts the compiled files in the bin directory, then runs the package.Main class
with argument_1 and argument_2 in the order they appear in the command.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl -m package.Main -l -cp bin:lib\f[R] --> runs the package.Main class
while adding the bin and lib directories to the project's classpath.
Please note that on Linux, the path separator is ':' and not ';'.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl -m Main -d lib -l\f[R] --> runs the Main class
while adding all JAR files from the lib directory to the project's classpath.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl -s src -o bin -m package.Main -cl -dt data\f[R] --> compiles the
Java project located in the src directory, places the compiled files in the bin directory,
runs the package.Main class, and copies the data directory to the bin directory.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl -f config.txt -cl\f[R] --> loads options from the
config.txt file.
Contents of the config.txt file:
\f[CR]-s src -o bin -m package.Main\f[R].
Compiles and runs the Java project located in the src directory,
puts the compiled files in the bin directory, and then runs the package.Main class.
.SH DEFAULT BEHAVIOR
By default, if no options are specified, the \f[CR]mvnl\f[R] command displays
the help page, which is shown with the \f[CR]-h\f[R] or \f[CR]--help\f[R] option.
This help page is different and simpler than the manual page
shown with the \f[CR]man mvnl\f[R] command.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS All Options
-v , --version Display the version and exit.
.PP
-cr , --create Create the project tree as well as a file
default config. If the output folder is not specified, the
Default folder is the current folder.
.PP
-s , --source Root directory of the project to compile.
.PP
-o , --output Directory for compiled files output.
.PP
-cp , --classpath List of JAR files to add
to the classpath during compilation and execution.
JAR files should be separated by ':'.
The default classpath is the output directory of the compiled files
if the -o option is used, otherwise, the program will prompt you to specify the classpath.
.PP
-d , --dependency Directory containing JAR files used by the
program.
All JAR files at the root of this directory will be added to the
classpath during compilation and execution.
.PP
-n , --name Change the name of the file containing the paths
of Java files to compile. The default name is `compile.list'.
Only usable with the -c option.
.PP
-e , --encoding Change the encoding of Java files to
compile. The default encoding is `UTF-8'.
Only usable with the -c option.
.PP
-m , --main Main class to run.
Only usable with the -l option.
.PP
-dt , --data Directory containing project data.
Copies the data directory to the output directory.
Only usable with the -c option.
.PP
-arg , --arguments Arguments to pass to the main class.
One argument per option, which means if you want to pass two
arguments, you should use the -arg option twice.
The order of arguments passed to the main class is the same as
the order on the command.
Command-line arguments take precedence over
arguments from the configuration file.
Arguments cannot contain spaces, or they will result in a bug.
Only usable with the -l option.
.PP
-f , --file Configuration file.
Loads options from a
configuration file, with space and newline separators.
Options from the configuration file take precedence over command-line options.
The -f option must be the first option on the command line.
.PP
-c , --compilation Compile the project.
.PP
-l , --launch Run the project.
.PP 
-cl , --compile-launch Compile and run the project.
(Equivalent to -c -l)
.PP
-lc , --launch-compile Compile and run the project.
(Equivalent to -l -c)
.PP
-h , --help Display help and exit.
.SS Mandatory options for compilation are:
-s , --source Root directory of the project to compile.
.PP
-o , --output Directory for compiled files output.
.PP
-c , --compilation Compile the project.
.SS Mandatory options for running are:
-m , --main Main class to run.
.PP
-l , --launch Run the project.
.PP
-cp , --classpath See the -cp option in the list of options above.
.SS Mandatory options for compilation and running are:
-s , --source Root directory of the project to compile.
.PP
-o , --output Directory for compiled files output.
.PP
-m , --main Main class to run.
.PP
-cl , --compile-launch Compile and run the project.
(Equivalent to -c -l)
.SH RETURN CODES
0: Everything went well.
.PP
1: An error occurred.
.SH FILES
Maven Lite consists of only 2 files.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]'mvnl'\f[R], the main file located in the '/usr/bin/' directory.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]'mvnl.1.gz'\f[R], the help file containing the manual page
displayed with the \f[CR]man mvnl\f[R] command, located in the
\f[CR]'/usr/local/man/fr/man1/'\f[R] directory.
.SH BUGS
There is a single known bug related to arguments with spaces,
whether on the command line or in the configuration file.
Therefore, arguments should not contain spaces.
