.SH NAME
mvnl \[en]Simple and lightweight Java project manager inspired by the
\[CR]Maven\[R] project manager.
.SH SYNOPSIS
mvnl [OPTION]...
[ARGUMENT]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Allows compiling and running a Java project using minimal
options and manipulation.
Simplifies Java project compilation and execution more
easily than Maven.
.PP
All options take a single argument except \[en]c and \[en]l which take none.
.PP
The order of options does not matter except for
the \[en]f option, which must be the first option on the
command line.
Double quotes are not required unless the argument
contains a space.
.PP
Options that are used with \[en]c when they are only usable
with \[en]l are ignored, and vice versa.
Options that are usable with \[en]c or \[en]l are usable with \[en]cl
and \[en]lc.
.PP
Mandatory arguments for long options are also mandatory for
short options.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl \[en]s src \[en]o bin \[en]c \[en]e UTF\[en]8\f[R] \[en] \[en] compiles the Java project
with UTF\[en]8 encoding located in the src directory and places the
compiled files in the bin directory.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl \[en]s src \[en]o bin \[en]m package.Main \[en]cl\f[R] \[en] \[en] compiles and
launches the Java project located in the src directory and places the
compiled files in the bin directory, then runs the
package.Main class.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl \[en]s src \[en]o bin \[en]m package.Main \[en]lc \[en]arg argument_1 \[en]arg argument_2\f[R]
\[en] \[en] compiles and launches the Java project located in the src
directory and places the compiled files in the bin directory, then runs the
package.Main class with arguments argument_1 and argument_2 in
the order they appear in the command.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl \[en]m package.Main \[en]l \[en]cp bin:lib\f[R] \[en] \[en] runs the
package.Main class by adding the bin directory and lib directory to the project's classpath.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl \[en]m Main \[en]d lib \[en]l\f[R] \[en] \[en] runs the Main class by
adding all JAR files in the lib directory to the project's classpath.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl \[en]s src \[en]o bin \[en]m package.Main \[en]cl \[en]dt data\f[R] \[en] \[en] compiles the Java project located in the src directory and places the
compiled files in the bin directory, then runs the package.Main class
and copies the data folder to the bin directory.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl \[en]f config.txt \[en]cl\f[R] \[en] \[en] loads options from the
config.txt file.
Contents of the config.txt file:
\f[CR]\[en]s src \[en]o bin \[en]m package.Main\f[R].
Compiles and launches the Java project located in the src directory and places
the compiled files in the bin directory, then runs the package.Main class.
.SH DEFAULT BEHAVIOR
By default, if no options are specified, the command
\f[CR]mvnl\f[R] displays the help page, which is also displayed with
the \f[CR]\[en]h\f[R] or \f[CR]\[en]\[en]help\f[R] option.
This help page is different and simpler than the man page
displayed with the \f[CR]man mvnl\f[R] command.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS All Options
\[en]v , \[en]\[en]version Display the version and exit.
.PP
\[en]s , \[en]\[en]source Root directory of the project to compile.
.PP
\[en]o , \[en]\[en]output Output directory for compiled files.
.PP
\[en]cp , \[en]\[en]classpath List of JAR files and the output directory of the
compiled files (same directory as the \[en]o option) to add
to the classpath during compilation and execution.
JAR files must be separated by ':'.
The default classpath is the output directory of the compiled files
if the \[en]o option is used; otherwise, the classpath is the
current directory.
.PP
\[en]d , \[en]\[en]dependency Directory containing the JAR files used by the
program.
All JAR files will be added to the classpath during compilation
and execution.
.PP
\[en]n , \[en]\[en]name Change the name of the file containing the Java file paths
to compile.
The default name is `compile.list'.
Only usable with the \[en]c option.
.PP
\[en]e , \[en]\[en]encoding Change the encoding of the Java files to
compile. The default encoding is `UTF\[en]8'.
Only usable with the \[en]c option.
.PP
\[en]m , \[en]\[en]main Main class to launch.
Only usable with the \[en]l option.
.PP
\[en]dt , \[en]\[en]data Directory containing project data.
Allows copying the data folder to the output folder.
Only usable with the \[en]c option.
.PP
\[en]arg , \[en]\[en]arguments Arguments to pass to the main class.
One argument per option, meaning that if you want to pass two
arguments, you should use the \[en]arg option twice.
The order of the arguments passed to the main class is the same as
the order of passage on the command line.
Command line arguments take precedence over
arguments from the configuration file.
Arguments cannot contain spaces or they may cause issues.
Only usable with the \[en]l option.
.PP
\[en]f , \[en]\[en]file Configuration file.
Allows loading options from a configuration file, with space and
newline as separators. Configuration file options take precedence
over command line options.
The \[en]f option

 must be the first option on the command
line.
.PP
\[en]c , \[en]\[en]compile Compile the project.
.PP
\[en]l , \[en]\[en]launch Launch the project.
.PP
\[en]cl , \[en]\[en]compile\[en]launch Compile and launch the project.

.PP
\[en]lc , \[en]\[en]launch\[en]compile Compile and launch the project.
(equivalent to \[en]c \[en]l)
.PP
\[en]h , \[en]\[en]help Display help and exit.
.SS Mandatory Options for Compilation are:
\[en]s , \[en]\[en]source Root directory of the project to compile.
.PP

.SS Mandatory Options for Compilation and Launching are:
\[en]s , \[en]\[en]source Root directory of the project to compile.
.PP
\[en]o , \[en]\[en]output Output directory for compiled files.
.PP

.SH FILES
Maven Lite consists of only 2 files.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl\f[R], the main file located in the
\f[CR]/usr/bin\f[R] directory.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]mvnl.1.gz\f[R], the help file containing the man page
displayed with the \f[CR]man mvnl\f[R] command, located in the
\f[CR]/usr/local/man/fr/man1\f[R] directory.
.SH BUGS
There is one known bug concerning arguments with spaces,
whether on the command line or in the configuration file.
Therefore, arguments should not contain spaces to avoid issues.
